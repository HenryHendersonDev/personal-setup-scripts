# Personal Setup Scripts

This repository contains configuration files and shell scripts that are tailored to my personal preferences for setting up a Linux-based system. These scripts and settings are designed to automate the process of configuring my desktop environment (primarily **Gnome**), installing software, and setting up various tools to streamline my workflow.

⚠️ **Note:** This repository is specifically intended for my own setup and may not be directly applicable to other users. Feel free to use the scripts and configurations as a reference, but be aware that they may require modification to work properly on different systems or environments.
